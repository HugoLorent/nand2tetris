# NAND2Tetris Project Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my implementations and solutions for the NAND2Tetris course, which guides students through building a complete computer system from the ground up â€“ from basic NAND gates to a functional modern computer.

## Project Structure
- `/01`: Boolean Logic - Basic logic gates implementation
- `/02`: Boolean Arithmetic - ALU and adders
- `/03`: Sequential Logic - Registers and memory
- `/04`: Machine Language - Assembly programs
- `/05`: Computer Architecture - CPU and memory implementation
- `/06`: Assembler - Translating assembly to machine code (implemented in Rust)
- `/07-08`: VM Translator - Handling stack-based virtual machine (implemented in Rust)
- `/09`: High-Level Language - Jack applications (basic calculator)
- `/10`: Jack Analyzer - Lexical and syntax analysis (implemented in Rust)
- `/11`: Jack Compiler - Complete Jack to VM code compiler (implemented in Rust)
- `/12`: Operating System - Complete OS implementation in Jack

## Usage
Each project folder contains the necessary implementation files along with test scripts provided by the course. To test implementations:

1. Use the Hardware Simulator for projects 1-5
2. Use the provided testing tools for software components in projects 6-12

For the Assembler (Project 6):
```bash
cd projects/6/hack_assembler
cargo run -- <input_file.asm>
```

For the VM Translator (Projects 7-8):
```bash
cd projects/8/vm_translator
cargo run -- <input_folder>
```

For the Jack Analyzer (Project 10):
```bash
cd projects/10/jack_analyzer
cargo run -- <input_file.jack or input_folder>
# Generates tokenization (.T.xml) and syntax analysis (.xml) files in output/ folder
```

For the Jack Compiler (Project 11):
```bash
cd projects/11/jack_compiler
cargo run -- <input_file.jack or input_folder>
# Generates VM code (.vm), tokenization (.T.xml) and syntax analysis (.xml) files in output/ folder
```

For the Operating System (Project 12):
```bash
cd projects/11/jack_compiler
cargo run -- ../12/
# Compiles all OS classes to VM code in projects/12/output/
```
